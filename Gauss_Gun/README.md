Gauss Gun Project

A simple single-stage Gauss gun (coilgun) that uses a high-voltage capacitor 
and a coil to launch a metallic projectile using electromagnetic force.

How It Works

Power Supply: Two 9V batteries power a boost converter.
Charging: The converter charges a 450V, 1000µF capacitor.
Trigger: A push-button activates a power transistor (MOSFET/IGBT) to discharge the capacitor through a coil.
Launch: The coil generates a magnetic pulse, accelerating the projectile.
