Arduino Coffee Machine Project

This was my very first semester project — a basic coffee machine built using an Arduino Uno. 
The machine automates the process of making a cup of coffee by controlling heating, mixing, and dispensing operations.

Features

Heater: Warms up water to the desired temperature.
Mixer: Stirs coffee and water together for a consistent blend.
Water Motor: Pumps water into the cup.
Coffee Motor: Fills the cup with coffee.

Control System

The entire system is controlled by an Arduino, w
ith timed sequences and digital outputs managing each stage of the coffee-making process.

Components

Arduino Uno  
Heating element  
DC motors for mixer, water pump, and coffee dispenser  
Transistors or relays for motor control  
Power supply  
Basic buttons or sensors (optional for automation)

This project introduced me to hardware control, timing logic, 
and basic automation — a great foundation for future embedded systems work.
