Arduino Xylophone Project

This project is a simple electronic xylophone built using an Arduino UNO R4, two Li-ion batteries, and a buck converter to safely power the board. 
The system plays musical tones using a piezo buzzer and is controlled with a single button.

Power Management

To power the Arduino from two Li-ion batteries (~7.4V), we used a buck converter to 
step down the voltage to a safe 5V input level.

Functionality

- One button cycles through and plays predefined musical tones.
- A piezo buzzer produces the xylophone sound.
- Timing and tone generation are controlled via the Arduino sketch.

Team

This project was created in collaboration with Gor, Yeva, Tigran.
